# CVwizard Language Selector Analysis

## Original HTML Analysis

The provided HTML was from CVwizard.com's language selection page. Here are the key findings:

### Structure
- **Purpose**: Language selection landing page for a CV/resume builder website
- **Languages Supported**: 27 different languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Arabic, and many others
- **Layout**: Centered design with logo, title, and grid of language links

### Technical Details
- **Framework**: Built with Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework)
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first responsive design with breakpoints
- **Brand Colors**: Blue color scheme (#2a72d7 primary brand color)

### Issues with Original Code
1. **Bloated CSS**: Over 200 lines of inlined Tailwind CSS
2. **Tracking Scripts**: Multiple analytics and tracking implementations
   - Google Tag Manager
   - Customer.io analytics
   - Cookiebot consent management
   - Custom tracking scripts
3. **Unnecessary Metadata**: Extensive OpenGraph and meta tags
4. **Hidden Element**: Language selector was initially hidden (`class="hidden"`)
5. **Security**: Nonce attributes for CSP (Content Security Policy)
